# floating-button-wp
A floating button that reveals a hidden element when clicked.

The plugin creates a floating button and a sidebar within WordPress.

The button when clicked, shows the contents of the sidebar.

This was basically used to hide a form which becomes visible when the button is clicked but feel free to use it in your own WordPress sites for any purpose.

If you feel anything can be improved or have suggestions, please feel free to open up issues or submit pull requests.
