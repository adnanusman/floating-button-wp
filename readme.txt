A floating button that reveals a hidden element when clicked.

== Description ==

The plugin creates a floating button and a sidebar within WordPress.

The button when clicked, shows the contents of the sidebar.

This was basically used to hide a form which becomes visible when the button is clicked but feel free to use it in your own WordPress sites for any purpose.

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate plugin.
2. You need to enable the button from the Theme Customizer options. There should be a new section called: Floating Button
3. You can change the button text, colors etc from these settings as well.
4. Add something to the 'Content Sidebar' that is also created once the plugin is activated. Anything you add in this sidebar will become visible once the button is pressed, and will go back into its hiding state if the button is pressed again.
